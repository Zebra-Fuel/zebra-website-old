                            <p>You may never use another User’s Account without permission. When creating your Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and you must keep your Account password secure.  We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account.</p>
                            <p>You must notify Zebra Fuel immediately at info@zebra-fuel.com of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your Account, or if your login details are lost, stolen or otherwise compromised.

                            <p>Termination of your use of the Services and the cancellation of your Account will not affect any of your obligations to pay any sums due to Zebra Fuel.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.</p>

                            <p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet and technology, our Platform is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.  This means that we are unable to promise that your use of the Platform will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free, or will meet your expectations, and we do not give any commitment relating to the performance or availability of the Platform in this Agreement.   To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude any commitments that may be implied by law.</p>
                            <p>To the extent permitted by law, we do not accept any responsibility whatsoever for any claims arising out of the provision of the Platform.</p>
                            <p>In every case, we will never be responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.</p>
                            <p>No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Zebra Fuel through our Services will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.</p>
                            <p>Zebra Fuel does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through our Platform or any hyperlinked website or service, and Zebra Fuel will not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.  The applicable laws of several jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.  This Agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary from the foregoing.  The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
                            <p>In the event of a claim arising out of your use of the Platform, Zebra Fuel's responsibility to you will never be more than the amount you have paid to Zebra Fuel in the 6 months prior to the claim arising and, in the event that you have not paid any money to Zebra Fuel in that period, Zebra Fuel will have no liability whatsoever to you.</p>
                            <h4 class="c-h2">11. Our Liability to You – Refueling Services</h4>

Loss or damage is foreseeable if the loss or damage was an obvious consequence of Zebra Fuel's breach or if the loss or damage was contemplated by you and Zebra Fuel at the time you and Zebra Fuel entered into the Agreement.</p>
                            <p>The maximum loss or damage Zebra Fuel will be responsible for under this Clause 12 is limited to the price you paid Zebra Fuel for the transaction to which the loss or damage you suffer relates; however, Zebra Fuel does not in any way exclude or limit its liability where it would be unlawful for Zebra Fuel to do so, including for:</p>
                            <p>(i) death or personal injury caused by Zebra Fuel's negligence;</p>
                            <p>(ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or</p>
                            <p>(iii) any breach of terms implied by law (such as those relating to title and quiet possession, description, satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and defective products) except to the extent such terms can be excluded or limed under applicable law.</p>
